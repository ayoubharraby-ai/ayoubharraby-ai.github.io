# Identity-Locked Mirror Selfie System (NanoBanana Edition)

Realistic phone mirror selfies **without identity drift** — built as a constraint system, not a “100 prompts” dump.

**Optimized for:** NanoBanana Pro (Gemini)  
**Format:** Plain-text prompt pack  
**Price:** Free (launch phase)

---

## What this is
A modular prompt system designed to keep a person **recognizable and unchanged** while generating believable mirror selfies:

- Identity preservation is **absolute**
- Phone realism only (no DSLR / studio simulation)
- No beautification, no reshaping, no stylization
- Reflection behavior must remain physically believable

---

## Who it’s for
- Creators who want **realistic** selfies, not “AI portraits”
- Beginners who keep getting face drift
- Anyone building consistent personal imagery across outputs

---

## How to use (NanoBanana Pro / Gemini)
1. Upload a clear reference photo of the person.
2. Copy one prompt from the pack.
3. Generate.
4. If a result drifts, discard it and rerun (don’t “average” bad outputs).

**Recommended aspect ratio:** 4:5 (phone selfie)
